Knowledge
=========
* Declarative - statement of facts
* Imperative - how to

Computer operations
===================
* calculation
* testing
* control flow

Computer programs
=================
* Fixed - computes precisely one computation
* Stored - interpreting sequence of instructions

Counters
========
* Points the computer to the next instruction to execute in a program

Turing Complete
===============
* Using 6 primitives can compute anything

Language aspects
================
* Primitive constructs
* Syntax
* Static semantic - syntactically valid and has meaning
* Full semantic - meaning associated with a syntactically correct string with no static semantic error

Goal
====
* Learn syntax and semantics
* Using elements to translate recipes that computers can understand
* Computationall mores
* 

Definitions
===========
* Syntax - determines whether a string is legal
* Static semantic - determines whether string has meaning
* Semantics - assigns meaning to legal sentence
